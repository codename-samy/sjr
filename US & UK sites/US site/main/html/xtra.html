        <h2>Price Match Policy</h2>
        <p>
          At TravelQuads, we are committed to providing you with the best
          possible travel deals. Our Price Match Policy ensures that you get the
          most competitive prices for your flights and travel bookings. Here's
          how it works:
        </p>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>
          If you find a lower price for the same flight or travel package on
          another website within 24 hours of booking with us, we'll match that
          price or refund the difference. Our Price Match Policy is designed to
          give you peace of mind, knowing that you're getting the best value for
          your travel expenses.
        </p>

        <h3>Eligibility</h3>
        <p>
          To be eligible for our Price Match Policy, the following conditions
          must be met:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The lower-priced offer must be for the same itinerary, including
            flight details, dates, and times.
          </li>
          <li>
            The offer must be publicly available and verifiable on the
            competitor's website at the time of our review.
          </li>
          <li>
            Price Match requests must be submitted within 24 hours of booking
            your flight or travel package with us.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Request a Price Match</h3>

          If you believe you have found a lower price that meets our eligibility

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Our team will review the price match request and verify its
            eligibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the request is approved, we will match the price or refund the
            difference to your original payment method.
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Price Match requests are limited to one per customer per booking.

        <h2>Taxes and Fees Policy</h2>
        <p>
          At TravelQuads, we are committed to providing transparent information
          about taxes and fees associated with booking travel services. Please
          review the following details to understand our policy:
        </p>

        <h3>Government Taxes</h3>
        <p>
          When booking airline tickets, hotels, or other travel services,
          government taxes may apply. These taxes are imposed by governmental
          authorities and can vary based on your travel destination, route, and
          class of service. The applicable taxes will be clearly displayed
          during the booking process, allowing you to review and accept them
          before finalizing your reservation.
        </p>

        <h3>Service Fees</h3>
        <p>
          TravelQuads may charge service fees for processing and facilitating
          your travel bookings. These fees are typically associated with the
          convenience and assistance we provide in securing your travel
          arrangements. The service fees, if applicable, will be disclosed
          before you confirm your booking.
        </p>

        <h3>Booking Fees</h3>
        <p>
          Some airlines and service providers may charge booking fees in
          addition to their base fares. These fees cover the cost of making
          reservations and issuing tickets. The specific booking fees, if any,
          will be outlined during the booking process, and you can choose to
          proceed with the booking or explore alternative options.
        </p>

        <h3>Baggage Fees</h3>
        <p>
          As mentioned in our Baggage Policy, baggage fees may apply for checked
          baggage and additional luggage. These fees are set by the airlines and
          may vary depending on the airline, travel class, and route. We
          recommend reviewing the baggage fees associated with your chosen
          airline before booking your flight.
        </p>

        <h3>Payment Processing Fees</h3>
        <p>
          When making payments for your bookings, credit card companies or
          payment processors may charge transaction fees or currency conversion
          fees. These fees are beyond our control and are determined by the
          respective financial institutions. Please check with your payment
          provider for details on any additional charges.
        </p>

        <h3>Transparent Pricing</h3>
        <p>
          TravelQuads is committed to providing transparent pricing. We strive
          to clearly communicate all applicable taxes and fees associated with
          your bookings upfront. You will have the opportunity to review and
          accept these charges before completing your reservation.

            taxes and fees, please don't hesitate to contact our customer
            support team. We are here to assist you and ensure your travel

        <h2>Post Ticketing Fees Policy</h2>
        <p>
          At TravelQuads, we are committed to transparency and ensuring that our
          customers have a clear understanding of our pricing policies. We want
          to clarify our stance on post-ticketing fees:
        </p>

        <h3>No Hidden Fees</h3>
        <p>
          We take pride in offering straightforward pricing for our flight
          tickets. When you book a flight through TravelQuads, the price you see
          at the time of booking is the final price you'll pay. We do not charge
          any hidden or surprise fees after ticketing.
        </p>

        <h3>All-Inclusive Pricing</h3>
        <p>
          Our ticket prices are all-inclusive, covering the base fare, taxes,
          and any applicable fees. You won't encounter additional charges for
          standard services such as seat selection, cabin baggage, or online
          check-in.
        </p>

        <h3>Fee Transparency</h3>
        <p>
          If there are any fees associated with optional services or upgrades,
          such as priority boarding, extra baggage, or in-flight meals, these
          fees will be clearly disclosed to you during the booking process. You
          have the choice to add or decline these services based on your
          preferences.
        </p>

        <h3>No Surprise Charges</h3>
        <p>
          Rest assured that when you complete your booking with TravelQuads,
          there won't be any unexpected charges or fees added to your ticket.
          The price you agree to during the booking process is what you'll pay.
        </p>

        <h3>Price Guarantee</h3>
        <p>
          We stand by our commitment to transparent pricing. Once you've booked
          your ticket, the price is locked in, and you won't be subject to any
          additional fees, even if there are changes or updates to the fare
          rules or airline policies.
