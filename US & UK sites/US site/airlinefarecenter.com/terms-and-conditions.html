    <div class="container">

        <p>Access to and use of the Airline Fare Center Website is contingent upon your unmodified acceptance of the terms, conditions, and notices outlined below, collectively referred to as the 'Terms' or 'Agreement.'

It is important to note that our Website is intended for use by residents of the United States, and these terms apply exclusively to residents of this region. Pursuant to this Agreement, we use your IP address to ascertain your location within this area.</p>

<p>WHEN YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO MANDATORY CLASS ACTION AND WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>

<p><strong>Use Of The Airline Fare Center Website</strong></p>

<p>There are specific conditions that you must meet in order to utilize our Website or make bookings through our travel agents. Therefore, you must ensure that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You are 18 years of age or older.</li>
    <li>You possess the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract with us.</li>
    <li>You agree to use Airline Fare Center in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</li>

    <li>If you create an account on AirlineFareCenter.com, you are responsible for its security, and our agents will diligently monitor the usage of your account to ensure that it is used only for legitimate purposes by you and no one else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Airline Fare Center reserves the right to deny access to our Website or services to any individual for reasons that we deem valid. This may include, but is not limited to, violations of the terms outlined in this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution Of Disputes</strong></p>

<p>By entering into this Agreement, you agree that Airline Fare Center has the opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims that may arise when dealing with our customer care agents. Such disputes could be related to the services we provide or issues arising from our Privacy Policy. You can contact our customer care team by calling <a class="call-phone-number" href="tel:+1-512-717-3799">+1-512-717-3799</a> or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@airlinefarecenter.com">info@airlinefarecenter.com</a>. In the event that we are unable to resolve the claims within a 60-day period, you have the option to seek resolution through arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction</strong></p>

<p>These Terms, as well as the rights and obligations of both parties and any third parties, are subject to the laws of the State of New Jersey, USA, unless otherwise specified. It is mutually agreed by both parties that any mandatory arbitration will take place exclusively within the jurisdiction of the New Jersey courts. By using our services, you consent to this jurisdiction. Unless otherwise specified, any claims must be brought to our attention within 6 months from the date of booking.</p>
        
<p><strong>Mandatory Arbitration</strong></p>

<p>All claims will be resolved through arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA). However, you must assert your claims on an individual basis in small claims court in New Jersey if they meet the criteria set forth by the small claims court. This includes claims made against Airline Fare Center, our subsidiaries, affiliates, travel service providers, or affiliated companies. This means that even if your claims arose prior to your acceptance of these Terms & Conditions, they are subject to arbitration as per this agreement. Airline Fare Center may also assert claims against you in small claims court. There will be no judges or court review of the arbitration agreement. As a user of Airline Fare Center, you have the choice to conduct the arbitration either over the phone or in person in the state where our office is located or at another mutually agreed-upon location.</p>

<p>To initiate the arbitration process, you must send a letter requesting arbitration, including details of your claims, to our legal team. In the event that we initiate arbitration against you, we will provide complete details and notice at the email address you have provided. We recommend reading the AAA's instructions, available at www.adr.org, or contacting them at <a class="call-phone-number" href="tel:+1-512-717-3799">+1-512-717-3799</a> for a better understanding of the process.</p>

<p>If any proceedings are initiated to resolve claims, they will be conducted on an individual basis and not as part of a class action or consolidated action. In any situation where a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, Airline Fare Center waives your right to a jury trial. Claims must be resolved according to the dispute resolution procedures stated here. Any claim that is not resolved through dispute resolution is considered inadequately filed or void.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Information - General</strong></p>

<p>Airline Fare Center provides you with comprehensive travel information, including details about your travel plans, itinerary, and the terms and conditions related to your bookings. This information is sourced from our third-party suppliers, which include airlines, tour operators, and other service providers. While we make every effort to ensure the accuracy and currency of the information we provide, we disclaim any responsibility and liability for inaccuracies. Please be aware that all information displayed on our website is subject to change without prior notice, and the availability of services is subject to change as well.</p>

<p>As a user of Airline Fare Center, you acknowledge that it is your responsibility to fulfill all legal requirements for travel, including but not limited to passports, visas, and health insurance, and to provide accurate and up-to-date information. We act solely as a service provider to assist you with the booking process through our desktop or mobile website and our customer support team. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring the accuracy of all information and carrying all necessary documents lies with you.</p>

<p>For additional booking terms and service terms on Airline Fare Center, please carefully review all the terms outlined here. If you make a flight booking with us, it is essential to review the terms and conditions of the airline on their website and ensure compliance with their terms and conditions. The airfare you book is guaranteed only after the purchase is completed and the transaction is confirmed. Afterward, we will issue a ticket provided to us by the supplier. Please be aware that airlines may change their prices without notice, and such changes are beyond our control. As a travel agency, we reserve the right to cancel bookings if payment is not received by the specified due date.</p>

<p>If your flight itinerary involves multiple airline suppliers, you must review the terms and conditions of each airline, which are readily accessible on their respective websites. Every airline has its own set of rules and restrictions regarding fees and charges. If your flight is affected by changes made by one airline that result in changes to your connecting flights, you are responsible for any associated costs, such as change fees or the purchase of new tickets for unaffected flights. Airlines typically charge fees for changes, refunds, or exchanges, which are your responsibility. You are required to comply with the terms and conditions of your airline, and these terms may vary from one airline to another.</p>

<p>When traveling, it is essential to carry both outbound and return tickets, along with the confirmation email, at all times. Airlines may request proof of return tickets during check-in, and we recommend that you book a combination of two one-way tickets instead of purchasing a round-trip ticket. This approach provides greater flexibility and a wider range of flight options. Please note that the terms and conditions for one-way flights differ from those of round-trip flights, and you may be responsible for additional charges in case of flight delays or changes. Airline Fare Center assumes no liability in such situations.</p>

<p>The prices displayed on our website for low-cost carriers are converted from a different currency to USD for your convenience. Due to currency conversion, the final amount you pay may vary slightly due to currency fluctuations. Additionally, when you receive your e-tickets, there may be an additional credit card transaction fee related to making a purchase in a different currency and country. International purchases may also incur taxes levied by your bank.</p>
        <div class="header-heading text-center">
            <h2>Airline Fare Center Flight Terms & Conditions</h2>
        </div>
        <p><strong>International Travel</strong></p>
        <p>For international travel, the Montreal Convention provisions apply to the countries of departure and destination. The Convention typically limits the liability of the airline supplier for passenger death or personal injury. It is the responsibility of the passenger to ensure they have all the required documents for entry into a foreign country, including a valid passport, visa (business, tourist, or transit), and the ability to present these documents when requested by government authorities. Meeting these entry requirements is the responsibility of the passenger, and we cannot be held accountable if they are not fulfilled. Passengers are also required to review any prohibitions, warnings, or advisories issued by the government of the destination country before travel.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Visa and Passport</strong></p>
        <p>Passengers must verify visa and passport requirements with the designated embassy before traveling. While we may provide recommendations, these requirements are subject to change, and passengers must obtain updated information from the embassy before finalizing their travel arrangements. Airline Fare Center cannot be held responsible if passengers are denied boarding due to a lack of required travel documents, such as a valid passport, visa, or any other necessary documents. These documents may be requested by authorities, the airline, or the destination country (including during transit), even if passengers do not leave the airport premises.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Health</strong></p>
        <p>We strongly recommend that passengers check for any required vaccinations for their destination country. Vaccination requirements may change, so it is essential to stay updated. Passengers should consult with a healthcare professional before departure to ensure compliance with all health requirements, including vaccinations, medications, and appropriate medical precautions for their travel.</p>

        <p><strong>Disinfection</strong></p>
<p>Many airlines have the authority and right to perform disinfection procedures if they suspect a threat to public health or the environment. The disinfectants used are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization. These procedures may include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Spraying aerosolized insecticide while passengers are on board.</li>
    <li>Treating the aircraft's surfaces with residual insecticide before passenger boarding.</li>
</ol>

<p>When Airline Fare Center books international travel for you, we do not represent the country or guarantee that it is safe to travel to that particular destination or that it involves no risks. We are not liable for any damages or losses you may incur as a result of traveling to a specific destination.</p>

<p id="airlinebaggagepolicylink"><strong>Airline Baggage Policies</strong></p>
<p>Each airline has its own policies regarding baggage allowances, fees, and restrictions. While Airline Fare Center strives to display the most current baggage allowance policies and obtains information from the airlines' websites, we cannot guarantee that the information is always up to date. Therefore, we recommend that you verify these details directly on the airline's website or by contacting the airline before your scheduled departure. Please note that baggage fees are not included in the trip cost.</p>

<p id="baggageprotectionpolicy"><strong>Baggage Protection Policy</strong></p>

<ul class="bgplcy">
    <li>The Baggage Protection service offered by Airline Fare Center is provided by Blue Ribbon Bags (BRB).</li>
    <li>By utilizing the BRB Baggage Protection service, in the event of a misplaced or mishandled checked-in bag, BRB tracks it on your behalf.</li>
    <li>Once your bag is located, BRB expedites the retrieval process and ensures that your bag is returned to you within 96 hours from the arrival time of your flight at the final destination.</li>
    <li>The BRB baggage protection service provides coverage of up to $1,000 per person in case your checked bag is lost.</li>
    <li>Reimbursement, up to a maximum of $1,000, is credited to your chosen mode of payment.</li>
    <li>The baggage protection service offered on Airline Fare Center is available for all flights, irrespective of the airline or destination listed on Airline Fare Center.com.</li>
    <li>BRB regularly sends updates regarding the status of your mishandled luggage to your registered email address for your convenience.</li>
    <li>If you opt for BRB protection, you are not required to provide proof or details of the bag if it is misplaced or mishandled by the airline.</li>
    <li>If the 96-hour deadline is not met, and BRB cannot locate your mishandled luggage, reimbursement is initiated according to the plan you selected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to Do If Your Baggage Is Lost</strong></p>
<ul class="bgplcy">
    <li>If you discover that your luggage is lost, you must report it to Airline Fare Center and BRB within 24 hours of your flight's arrival.</li>
    <li>To report the lost baggage, you can file a Mishandled Baggage Report on the BRB website or contact BRB at <a href="tel:888-224-4243">888-224-4243</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> You should first file a claim for your lost baggage with the airline before reporting it to Airline Fare Center and BRB.</p>

<p><strong>Check-In</strong></p>
<p>Various airlines have different check-in rules and requirements. It is essential to verify the specific check-in requirements for your chosen airline before making a booking. Airline Fare Center recommends following the following check-in schedule:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For domestic flights, check in a minimum of 90 minutes before the scheduled departure.</li>
    <li>For international flights, check in a minimum of 3 hours before the scheduled departure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Airline Schedule Changes</strong></p>
<p>Flight schedules may occasionally change due to factors such as inclement weather, mechanical or crew issues, or civil unrest. This may involve changing from a direct flight to a one-stop or connecting itinerary. In such cases, these changes are initiated directly by the airline, and Airline Fare Center is not responsible for these alterations.</p>
<p>If a schedule change results in a flight cancellation, Airline Fare Center will notify customers through both phone calls and emails. We will provide assistance in exploring alternative options in accordance with the airline's guidelines. However, there are instances where the airline may not provide prior notice of changes or cancellations. In such cases, it is the passenger's responsibility to contact the airline's customer service at least 72 hours before the scheduled departure time to confirm the flight schedule. This proactive step can help prevent missed flights.</p>
<p>In the event of a schedule change, the airline will provide available solutions, and the airline has the final authority in determining alternative flight options. Once you have checked in for your flight, it becomes the airline's responsibility to manage your booking. Any cancellations, delays, schedule changes, or rebookings are handled by the airline. While we can guide you through the process, the airline has the ultimate say. If you are unaware of any schedule changes or cancellations within 24 hours of departure or if you have already reached the airport, we recommend coordinating directly with airline staff to explore your available options. In situations involving inclement weather, your options may be limited.</p>

<p><strong>Flight Overbooking</strong></p>
<p>There are instances when a flight may be overbooked, and different airlines have varying policies in such situations. You can find detailed information about airline policies in their contract of carriage. If you require further information, feel free to reach out to Airline Fare Center's travel experts or contact the airline directly for clarification.</p>

<p><strong>Prices</strong></p>
<p>The prices listed on Airline Fare Center.com are subject to change at any time without prior notice. The fare provided is guaranteed only after the ticket is purchased, and we have issued a PNR (Passenger Name Record) to you. Airlines may change their prices at any time without advance notice.</p>
<p>Upon successful payment submission, we will send you a Booking Confirmation email containing your booking reference number, travel itinerary, and e-ticket. If you do not receive this confirmation, your booking is incomplete, and the fare may have changed by the time we issue the ticket.</p>
<p>We will inform you of any price changes before completing the booking process. Once your travel tickets are issued, no changes will be made to the ticket price under any circumstances.</p>
<p>All prices listed on Airline Fare Center are in USD (United States Dollars). We reserve the right to cancel bookings if full payment is not received within the specified time frame. The amount mentioned in the confirmation email must be utilized in the same sequence as the flight segments. Misuse of tickets may result in trip cancellation.</p>

<p><strong>Cancellations and Refunds</strong></p>
<p>Most bookings made on Airline Fare Center are non-refundable unless otherwise specified. If you need to cancel a booking, please contact our customer care desk at <a class="call-phone-number" href="tel:+1-512-717-3799">+1-512-717-3799</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:info@airlinefarecenter.com">info@airlinefarecenter.com</a>, and we will assist you with the cancellation process. In the case of a refundable cancellation, it is subject to an administrative cancellation fee as indicated in our <a href="post-ticketing-fees.html" target="_blank">Post-ticketing Fees</a> document, along with additional charges imposed by the airline or other travel service providers.</p>
<p>For us to process your refund request, it must comply with the airline's rules and procedures. We can process your refund only after receiving approval from the airline, and the refunded amount will be returned to your original payment method. Upon initiating the refund request, we will send you an email notification to keep you informed of the progress. During this process, we will deduct the service fee applied to the booking request and return the remaining balance. As a travel agency, we rely on suppliers to process refunds, which may take additional time to reflect on your credit card. This process can take up to 60-90 days from the date of the cancellation request.</p>
<p>You may encounter additional fees or fare differences imposed by the supplier, which will be added to the cost of your booking. After a booking is made, name changes are not permitted, and any such changes made post-booking will result in additional charges. Detailed information on this topic can be found in our <a href="taxes-and-fee.html" target="_blank">Taxes & Fees</a> document. To avoid such charges, please verify the spelling and names of passengers before confirming your booking.</p>

<p><strong>Contact Center Booking Service Fee</strong></p>
<p>When making a booking through our contact center, including complex multi-stop and roundtrip bookings, a service fee may be assessed by our agents. This fee ranges from $10 to $200 per passenger.</p>
<p><b>Important Note:</b> The service fee is included in the taxes, and you must pay the final quoted price regardless of any changes made to our service fee. Please carefully review the final booking amount before confirming your booking.</p>

<p><strong>Payment and Flight Information with Confirmation</strong></p>
<p>Credit card companies often charge fees for international transactions. These fees are known as "International Transaction" fees and will appear on your credit card statement in the local currency. They account for the difference between the billing amount displayed on the payment page and the amount reflected on your credit card statement. When booking with Airline Fare Center, consider using an international credit card company, as we transfer your payment to our suppliers. Your credit card company determines the exchange rate and transaction fee on the day of booking. If you have any discrepancies, please contact your credit card company to inquire about the fees and exchange rates they apply to your transaction. Airline Fare Center bears no responsibility for these fees.</p>

<p><strong>Special Request: Seats, Meals, and Frequent Flyer</strong></p>
<p>If you make a request for a special seat, meal, or frequent flyer miles, please understand that these are considered as requests only. While we will do our best to convey your requests to the airline, we cannot guarantee that they will be accommodated. Airlines have the exclusive right to make changes to your seat assignments without advance notice. Even if we allocate your requested seats, it is your responsibility to confirm with the airline, and we cannot guarantee that you will be assigned those seats. We also cannot guarantee that you will receive a specific meal, access to a frequent flyer program, or any other special request provided by the airline.</p>

<p><strong>Suitability of Travel Services</strong></p>
<p>Airline Fare Center offers a variety of travel services, but we do not endorse that these services are suitable for you. Any claims or concerns regarding the suitability or risks associated with a travel service do not bind us. All these services are listed on our website for your consideration and choice.</p>

<p><strong>Unaccompanied Minors</strong></p>
<p>As a policy, unaccompanied minors (individuals below the age of 16) are not allowed to make reservations on Airline Fare Center. Each airline has its own policies regarding unaccompanied minors, and some may not allow them to fly without an adult while others may permit it only on non-stop flights. Certain airlines may also charge an additional fee for unaccompanied minors at check-in. To obtain specific information, please contact the respective airline directly and inquire about their policies regarding unaccompanied minors.</p>

<p><strong>Credit Card Chargeback</strong></p>
<p>As a customer, you have the right to dispute travel charges with your credit card company. If you have any concerns or questions regarding a charge applied to your credit card, we encourage you to contact Airline Fare Center first before disputing the charge with your credit card company. Once we provide a resolution and address the disputed charges, you can then review the matter with your credit card company. If a chargeback is incorrectly filed, Airline Fare Center reserves the right to cancel your bookings as a remedy.</p>
<p>By making a booking with us as your service provider, you automatically accept and agree to our cancellation policy. Special offers, discounts, coupon codes, and other promotions published on the website are not eligible for cancellation. Improper chargebacks may result in charges to recover costs incurred by Airline Fare Center due to the dispute. To validate claims, we may use call recordings, including service calls, as evidence in the dispute resolution process.</p>

    <h2>Airline Fare Center Terms & Conditions - Hotel Reservations</h2>
</div>
<p>The photos and information provided on Airline Fare Center.com for hotels, their amenities, and products are shared by the suppliers. We do not take responsibility for any changes that may occur due to outdated or misrepresented updates provided by the suppliers. Special requests such as smoking/non-smoking rooms or views (e.g., lake-view/garden view) are made on a request basis and cannot be guaranteed. While hotels generally try to accommodate such requests, we cannot guarantee that your specific requests will be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Some quoted fares may require special memberships, such as corporate, government, AAA, or AARP memberships. To avail of offers under these rates, you must be able to prove your eligibility at the time of check-in. However, hotels are not obligated to honor special rates if you fail to qualify or provide the required identification. Neither Airline Fare Center nor the hotel supplier will issue a refund for unused room nights resulting from early check-out.</p>

<p>Some hotel suppliers offer additional services like airport shuttles. To avail of these services, you must contact the hotel directly to confirm availability and pricing. Some hotels may also offer booking bonuses for complimentary services such as tours and breakfast. Availability of these services is at the discretion of the hotel and is not guaranteed by us.</p>

<p><strong>Pet Policy:</strong></p>

<p>Pre-paid reservations are typically charged to your credit card at the time of booking. This charge covers the base room rate and does not include additional fees such as resort fees, energy surcharges, cleaning fees, or charges for items like meals, movies, games, parking, or phone calls. These additional charges, known as incidentals, are applied daily.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Paid Booking Vouchers:</strong></p>
<p>Some hotels may require a voucher at check-in. In such cases, Airline Fare Center will provide you with the necessary voucher, which you should present to the hotel authorities. You will receive your hotel confirmation in the same email you receive from us. We recommend carrying a printed copy of this confirmation with you at check-in.</p>

<p><strong>Meals:</strong></p>
<p>We arrange meals based on your selection during the booking process. If you book a hotel that includes meals, and you have paid for them, you will receive the specified meals. If you book an apartment-style accommodation, you may have the option to prepare your own meals.</p>

<p>Meal plans are often abbreviated as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Room Only (RO):</strong> No meals are included in the booking price.</li>

<p><strong>No-Show Policy:</strong></p>
<p>A "no-show" occurs when you fail to check in at the hotel without prior notice. If you do not check in as planned, it is your responsibility to contact the hotel. The hotel may then decide to charge you a penalty or forfeit your deposit.</p>

<p><strong>Hotel Confirmation:</strong></p>
<p>It may take up to 24 hours for hotels to issue vouchers and confirm your booking. The booking process begins after you make a booking on Airline Fare Center. Once you receive a booking confirmation email from us, our travel experts will work with the hotel to finalize the reservation details. We will then send you the confirmation, which includes your booking reference number, itinerary, and details of any additional services you have booked through us. If you do not receive the confirmation email, please contact us by phone and email at <a href="mailto:info@airlinefarecenter.com">info@airlinefarecenter.com</a>. We also recommend calling the hotel to confirm your booking 24 hours before your scheduled check-in.</p>

<p>If the hotel does not receive your details within 72 hours of your check-in time, they will contact you directly. Once your reservation is secured and guaranteed, you will receive our final confirmation, which includes your booking voucher. We recommend calling the hotel's check-in desk three days before your arrival to confirm the details.</p>

<p>Airline Fare Center does not collect or remit taxes to taxing authorities. The suppliers listed on our platform act as vendors and apply taxes, which are billed to us and paid directly to them. We are not co-vendors with these suppliers and do not have any direct association with them, even if we facilitate your bookings with them. Tax rates and regulations may vary depending on the location of the booking. When you make a hotel reservation, we charge your credit or debit card for the taxes to be collected and remitted to the jurisdiction where the hotel is located, based on the taxes owed on the amount we retain for providing our services.</p>

<p>Currency conversion is based on approximate exchange rates provided for reference during the booking process and may not reflect the exact amount. Taxes are typically assessed on a per-night, per-room basis by hotels and are incurred as guests access various services, including meals, movies, games, parking, and phone calls.</p>

<p><strong>Source of Inventory</strong></p>
<p>As a booking agent, we do not assume responsibility for errors except those made by us. Our Terms and Conditions are governed by US law unless the hotel supplier specifies that their contract is governed by the laws of another country or the country where you are using their services. In the event of a dispute, US law will prevail, and you will address the matter in the New Jersey Court. If a dispute arises regarding a booking made through Airline Fare Center, it will be handled according to the terms outlined in this Agreement in the New Jersey Court.</p>
