                    <strong>Flight Changes</strong>
                    <br />
                    Any kind of cancellations on the flight, relevant changes and rights are handled by the terms and conditions of the airline related to the carrier. As a result, you may be eligible for:
                    <br />
                    Another flight of the same carriage within the same airline company without an additional charge.
                    <br />
                    A different airline re-routes to the preferred location without additional charges.
                    <br />
                    A Full refund (If applicable) and, other remedies or rights.
                    <br />
                    If a change in the itinerary schedule before your arrival of the receipt shows the total fare, or before your ticket’s issuance (regarding either return or outbound), we will try to do everything within our capacity to bring it to your notice on behalf of the airlines

                    <strong>Cancellation by You</strong>
                    <br />
                    If you or any of your travelling companions listed in the booking chooses to cancel the booking, it is your sole responsibility to notify us at the earliest. Any intimation given through telephone must be confirmed in a written format via e-mail within 24 hours prior to the departure by the person who booked the package with us. The cancellation will take effect on the same day we receive the written confirmation within 24 hours of the notification.
                    <br />
                    If you need to change or cancel your travel plans, it is your responsibility to notify us in writing of such a request. Notifying us is not enough in many cases as we have automated software to issue many of our tickets instantly. These tickets are discount tickets, which have restrictions on them and may be up to 100% non-refundable and non-changeable. We charge a service fee for any changes or cancellations to fares if the airline allows it. In addition to our charges, most airlines also have a penalty or cancellation fee for any changes or cancellations to fares.
