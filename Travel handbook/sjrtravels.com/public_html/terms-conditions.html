By accessing, browsing and using the Site and/or by making a booking through SJR Travels, you acknowledge and agree to having read, understood and agreed to the Terms of Use.</p>
                        <p>Our different policies and guidelines, which can be found throughout the Site, including but not limited to, the Privacy Policy, Lowest Rate/Best Price Guarantee, Booking Guarantee, Cancellation Policy, Refund Policy, FAQs, etc., should be read in conjunction with and are an integral part of these terms and conditions and are hereby included by reference. The terms and conditions set out below and the Policies are collectively referred to as the "Terms of Use". If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, please cease use of the Site immediately. The Terms of Use - as may be amended from time to time - constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any other agreements or understandings (oral or written), between you and us with respect to their subject matters unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>
                        <h4>Booking Policy</h4>
                        <p>When you book a ground handling service or purchase a tour package through www.sjrtravels.com, you will receive an email confirming your booking as well as the tour itinerary for your selected package. Your reservation through www.sjrtravels.com also means you accept all terms and conditions mentioned or referred to on www.sjrtravels.com.</p>
                        <p>You can change or cancel your tour booking either online under your Reservations when signed into sjrtravels.com account, or by calling our customer services number. There will be no reservations against your transfer services or package during quotation, for reservation you have to select book the package and automatically the payment & confirmation deadline will come. You have to confirm & secure your reservation by paying against the invoice amount.</p>
                        <p>Please note that it is your responsibility to check the details of your reservation before you submit the reservation and after your booking is confirmed. Cancellation fees or processing fees, as set out in this site, will be changed for any cancellation or amendment to your reservation or purchase. Should you wish to cancel or amend your bookings, you can make the changes through your member page.</p>
                        <p>These terms and conditions may not be changed by any unauthorized person, including employees of sjrtravels.com.</p>
                        <h4>Cancellation Policy</h4>
                        <p>If you do not show up at the hotel or checkout early without advance notice you are not entitled to any refund. This term may be varied subject to the relevant hotel's private cancellation policy and is subject to change at any given time without prior notice.</p>
                        <p>Cancellation Policy is applicable per transaction and is based on the individual component cancellation policy stated on the voucher sent to the email specified by the logged in customer.</p>
                        <p>You agree to pay any supplier required cancellation or change fees that you incur. In limited cases, some hotels do not permit changes to or cancellations of reservations after they are made, as indicated in the rules and restrictions for the hotel reservation. You agree to abide by the terms and conditions imposed with respect to your prepaid hotel reservations.</p>
                        <h4>Refund Policy</h4>
                        <p>When you cancel a booking and are entitled to a refund then we will instruct the refund as soon as practicable. The processing may take between 2-4 weeks until the whole amount is credited back and appears on your credit card statement. The reasons for this are the billing cycle of your credit card company and processing time of the bank. The refund amount depends on numerous factors such as the hotel's cancellation policy, time of cancellation and processing fees. See above cancellation policy for a more detailed list. In case a reservation that you make is not confirmed, we will not charge anything on your credit card and will release the whole amount that was held on it immediately. After this is done, it will still take a period of about 2-4 weeks for the bank to process this and for the whole amount to be credited back and appear on your credit card statement.</p>
                        <p>All the refunds of any transaction's amount against any purchase through this website would be refunded to the original mode of payment</p>
                        <h4>Changes or Cancellation by www.sjrtravels.com</h4>
                        <p>We reserve the right to make changes or cancellations after the reservation at any time. However, we will endeavour not to make a major change or cancel the booking within 72 hours of the arrival date, except by unforeseen events.</p>
                        <p>If we have to make a major change to your arrangements after booking, we will offer you the option of accepting the change or cancelling the booking and receiving a full refund of any monies paid to us. We do not accept responsibility for any expenses or costs you may incur as a result of any change.</p>

                        <p>Any change or amendments are subject to availability at the time you make the request.</p>
