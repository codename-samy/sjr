In case we are unable to resolve the Claims within 60-days, you can seek redress via arbitration.</p>
        <p><strong>Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction</strong></p>
        <p>Terms and our rights along with the third parties' are under the governing laws of the State of New Jersey, USA. If not mentioned otherwise, it is decided and mutually agreed upon by both the parties that in case of a Mandatory Arbitration it will undergo in an exclusive jurisdiction of New Jersey court. As a user, you have given FareObuddy the consent to decide this. Unless mentioned differently, you must bring any Claims to our notice within 6-months of the date of booking.</p>

        <p><strong>Mandatory Arbitration</strong></p>
        <p>Any claims that are filed will be resolved via arbitration which is initiated by the American Arbitration Association (AAA). With that, you must assert the Claims on ab individual basis in small claims court in New Jersey. If your claims are qualified as per the rules of small claims court, they are stated by it. This is inclusive of claims asserted on FareObuddy, any of our subsidiaries and our affiliates. This includes our travel suppliers or companies linked to us. This also means that any Claims that arise before your acceptance of the Terms & Conditions, even though the previous version required changes. FareObuddy can assert claims against you at the small claims court. There will be no judges in the agreement or the court will be required for a review of the agreement. But being a user of FareObuddy, you can the arbiter and award the same or similar damages which include statutory damages, attorney’s fees, and costs that a court follows to enforce these Terms. You have the choice to conduct the arbitration over the phone or be physically present in the state where our office is located or any other location which is mutually agreed upon. </p>
        <p>To begin the process of arbitration, you must send a letter of request for the same which entails the details of your Claims to our legal team. In case we request for arbitration against you, we will give you complete details with a notice at the email address shared by you. You are requested to read the AAA's instructions available at www.adr.org or reach out to them on <a class="call-phone-number" href="tel:1-631-309-0576">1-631-309-0576</a> for better understanding.</p>
        <p>If any proceedings aim at resolving the Claims, they will be conducted on an individual basis and not the form of a class action or consolidated action. Under any particular circumstances, in case a Claim proceeds in the court instead of in arbitration, FareObuddy waives your right to a jury trial. Resolution of disputes must resolve the claims stated against FareObuddy. Any Claim filed which is not resolved by Resolution of Disputes is deemed as inadequately filed or void.</p>

        <p><strong>Travel Information - General</strong></p>
        <p>FareObuddy provides you with all the information linked to your travel plans, itinerary, and Terms after you make the booking. This information also includes the details of destination, affordable packages, and your flight schedule. </p>
        <p>This information is given to us through our third-party suppliers which include airlines, tour operators, and other providers. We have taken all the steps to make sure that the information we share with you is accurate and current. But if it is not, we do not have any responsibility for the same and have no liability in such a case. You must also understand that all the information displayed on our website is subject to change without prior notice. Also, the services offered by us are subject to availability. As a user of FareObuddy, you understand all the legal needs of traveling include passport, visa, health insurance, and will supply us with the same to complete your booking. We are simply service providers and are here to assist you with the process through our desktop or mobile website and our customer support team. The end responsibility to get all the information accurate and to carry all the documents needed remains solely on you. </p>
        <p>For other Terms of bookings and Services availed on FareObuddy, you are required to read all the Terms mentioned here carefully. In case you make a flight booking with us, you must make sure that you have gone through the terms of the airlines on their website. Also, ensure that you abide by all of their terms and conditions. The airfare that you book can only be guaranteed after you make a purchase and complete the transaction. Post this process, we will issue a ticket provided to us by the supplier. Sometimes the airline may change their prices without informing us and these changes are not dependent on us. We as a travel agency have the right to cancel the booking if we do not receive your payment by the date of allocation. If your flight itinerary has more than one airline supplier then you must go through the terms and conditions of both the airlines. These terms are easily accessible on the airline's website. Every airline has a different set of rules and restrictions on their fee and charges. So if your flight is affected due to a change (canceled or rescheduled) that the airline made which further results in a change to your other flight, you are the person responsible for the same. In such a scenario, you will have to bear the cost of the fees or buy new tickets for the unaffected flight. Usually, the airline charges a fee for making a change, refund, or exchange, and that cost is borne by you. You are required to comply with the terms of your airline and all the rules differ from airline to airline. You must carry your outbound and return tickets with the confirmation mail with you at all times during your travel. The airline authorities may ask you to show proof of your return tickets at the time of check-in. FareObuddy recommends that you book a combination of two one-way tickets instead of purchasing one round-trip.</p>
        <p>We recommend this because when you book in a combination of two one-way tickets, we can offer you better flexibility and more choices of flights. These flights are usually cheaper if booked on different airlines as compared to the ones booked on the same airline. The terms of a combination of a one-way flight are different from the round-trip flight. The one-way flights are subject to their set terms and conditions. So if there is a change in your first flight leading to a delay in the other flight, as a customer you will be required to pay the applicable charges. In such a scenario, FareObuddy holds no responsibility for the same. The prices displayed on our website for low-cost carriers are converted from a different currency to USD. We do this for your convenience. Due to the conversion, you pay us an estimated (and not exact) value of the ticket purchased, and there might be an off-chance that the amount paid varies due to currency fluctuation. When you receive your e-tickets, you might have to bear an additional fee on your credit card as a transaction fee for paying in a different currency and country. When you make an international purchase, there are applicable taxes by levied by your bank. </p>

            <h2>FareObuddy Terms & Conditions – Flights</h2>
        </div>
         <p><strong>International Travel(s)</strong></p>
        <p>During your international travel, the provisions of the Montreal Convention are applicable to the countries of departure and your destination. The Convention usually limits the liability of the airline supplier for death or any personal injury of the passengers. As a passenger, you must make sure that you have all the documents required to make an entry in the foreign land. These documents include passport, visa (business, tourist, or transit) and you are able to present these documents at any time when the government asks for it. When you want to enter a foreign land, there are several responsibilities that you must meet and we cannot be held responsible if you fail to accomplish them. You are required to go through all the prohibitions, warnings, and announcements that are issued by the government before you reach the destination country.  </p>
       
         <p><strong>Visa and Passport</strong></p>
        <p>You must make sure that you consult the designated Embassy and confirm the visa and passport information prior to traveling. We may suggest the requirements but those might change at any time, so you must have the updated information from the Embassy before confirming your tickets with us. FareObuddy cannot be held responsible if you are not allowed to travel in the flight as you were unable to provide the required travel documents (eg., correct passport, visa, or any other predefined required documents.) The authorities, the airline, or the country (including transit) may ask for them at any point in time and you must present them. This includes any stop made by the aircraft even if you don't leave the airport premises.</p>

        <p><strong>Check-In</strong></p>
        <p>There are different check-in rules followed by the different airline providers. You are required to verify the requirements of the check-in process before making a booking. FareObuddy advises that you follow the given check-in schedule:  </p>
        <p>For a domestic flight, a minimum of 90 minutes before scheduled departure<br />
            For an international flight, a minimum of 3 hours scheduled departure. </p>

        <p><strong>Airline Schedule Change</strong></p>
        <p>Sometimes there are changes in the flight schedule that occur due to reasons like bad weather, mechanical or crew issues, or civil unrest. This includes a change to the original flight from a direct one to a one-stop or a connecting itinerary. In such scenarios, the changes are initiated by the airline directly, and FareObuddy holds no responsibility for the same. </p>
        <p>If the schedule change includes a cancellation, then we will notify our customers by calling them and sending across an email that will assist you with other options and choose one depending upon the airlines' guidelines. In some cases, the airline does not inform us of the changes or the cancellation in advance. For the same reason, you must reach out to the airline's customer service team to confirm your flight schedule. You must make this call at least 72-hours before the departure time and this will protect you against a missed flight.</p>
        <p>In case of a schedule change, the airline helps you with the available recourse, and it is their final authority to provide an alternative flight option. Once you check-in for your flight, it is the airline's responsibility to handle your booking. So, in case of any cancellations, delays, change of schedule, or rebooking of your flight is done by the airline. In such cases, we can only guide you with the procedure; final recourse is taken by the airline.   In case you do not have an update of the change in schedule, or cancellation 24-hour before the time of departure, you or you have already reached the airport, we advise you coordinate with the airline staff and get to know more about your available options. During such a time, the airline is your best source of information and will deliver the best advice to you. In incidents like bad weather, you have limited options.</p>
